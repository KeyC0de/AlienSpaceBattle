Their names indicate the author.
Some don't. And I don't remember their original names, but they are on the public domain on FreeSounds.com
If somebody's offended by this I can search my download history on FreeSounds.com to find their names and list them.

Graphics mostly from me, a couple of them on the public domain I snatched from Google images, don't remember exactly where I got them from.
